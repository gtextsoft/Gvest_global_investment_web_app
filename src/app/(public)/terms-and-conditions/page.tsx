          this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data and
          isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. We may
          dispose of any data in our discretion without notice, subject to
          applicable law. We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period
          in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a

          potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
          Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data
          and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
